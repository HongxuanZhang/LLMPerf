You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama_fast.LlamaTokenizerFast'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message.
2024-09-24 01:39:41,120	WARNING utils.py:580 -- Detecting docker specified CPUs. In previous versions of Ray, CPU detection in containers was incorrect. Please ensure that Ray has enough CPUs allocated. As a temporary workaround to revert to the prior behavior, set `RAY_USE_MULTIPROCESSING_CPU_COUNT=1` as an env var before starting Ray. Set the env var: `RAY_DISABLE_DOCKER_CPU_WARNING=1` to mute this warning.
2024-09-24 01:39:41,120	WARNING utils.py:592 -- Ray currently does not support initializing Ray with fractional cpus. Your num_cpus will be truncated from 18.83076 to 18.
